title: STM32MP25 Reset Clock Controller

description: |
  The RCC hardware block is both a reset and a clock controller.
  RCC makes also power management (resume/supend).

  Specifying clocks
  =================

  All available clocks are defined as preprocessor macros in
  dt-bindings/clock/stm32mp25-clks.h header and can be used in device
  tree sources.
  This file implements defines like:
      #define CK_BUS_SDMMC1 245
      #define CK_KER_SDMMC1 313

  Specifying softreset control of devices
  =======================================

  Device nodes should specify the reset channel required in their "resets"
  property, containing a phandle to the reset device node and an index
  specifying which channel to use.
  The index is the bit number within the RCC registers bank, starting from RCC
  base address.
  It is calculated as: index = register_offset / 4 * 32 + bit_offset.
  Where bit_offset is the bit offset within the register.

  For example on STM32MP25, for LTDC reset:
     ltdc = RCC_LTDCCFGR offset / 4 * 32 + LTDC_bit_offset
          = 0x840 / 4 * 32 + 0 = 16896
